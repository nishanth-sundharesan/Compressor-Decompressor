1. If your lead engineer asked you how many bits we should be compressing the data to, what would your answer be?
Answer: I would say either 10 or 11 bits, because the data would be accurate upto 2 decimal points. But it all depends on the range of the data. If there is a single
large floating point value then the accuracy of the data will decrease.
